Work Order: SQL Data Type Documentation

Good morning devs,

We have some new database analysts starting this week but I think they're pretty green in terms of SQL knowledge. We are going to need to prepare them with some prep materials to make sure they have a good grasp of some of the fundamental SQL concepts.

We are going to start them off slow but at the bare minimum we need to ensure that they have an understanding of the different types of data that we work with in Postgres so that they understand our schemas and can create new table schemas effectively.

Requirement

Please create a blog post for the new devs coming in listing out and briefly explaining the different data types that are supported and maybe some example data for each type.

Please specify if any of the data types are specific to Postgres as well so they properly understand what is vendor specific vs. part of the SQL standard.

Please post this under your Medium blog account and share with us your completed results when you are complete.

Thaaaanks :D
